# The Depot Application
:package: The depot application from "Agile Web Development with Rails 4" book

I'm reading the [Agile Web Development with Rails 4](https://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails-4) book and wanted to use github in the development of the Depot Application in the **Part 2** of the book.
